Scholarship
=====

## We are in the process of establishing a scholarship fund

The details of this scholarship program are still being worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year the CUGOS membership will vote to award one or more scholarship grants in support of ongoing <a href="https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (based on funding availaiblity). Such projects might include but are not limited to:  QGIS, PostGIS, MapServer, GDAL/OGR and OpenLayers.

The details of the scholarship application process and selection criteria for eligible students will be determined by the CUGOS board. Stay tuned for updates!

OS Software Development Grant
=======

## We are in the process of establishing an open source software development fund

The details of this software development grant are still being worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year CUGOS membership will vote to award an Open Source Software Development Grant to suport specific, dedicated work for one or more ongoing <a href="https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (funding availablity permitting).

The selection to which project to dedicate the funds to, along with details about the subject and deliverables for the dedicated work will be determined by an open discussion and vote of the CUGOS members.

The amount of funding to be awarded (and which suitable entity to perform the work wil be selected) will need to be approved by a vote of the CUGOS board each year.
