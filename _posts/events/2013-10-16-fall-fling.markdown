<h3 id="morning_sesh">Morning Session: Talks (9am to 12:20pm)</h3>

**Intro** (5 minutes) - Aaron

**Keynote** (20 minutes):
<div id="detail">We would like to hear a keynote talk about how a team/person integrated opensource geospatial
tools into their organization where there was nothing opensource before. If you have sweet
talk about opensource geospatial stuff that does not cover this topic, then ping us anyway. We are
open to other ideas.</div>

**Short Talks** 5 slots open (15-20 min):
<div id="detail">We want to hear how academics, students and hackers are doing research or making cool tools
that help solve problems. See some of the talks from <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/CUGOS_2012_Spring_Fling">last year's Spring Fling</a>
to get the general idea.</div>

1. Touring the GINA Zoo -- Big Data, Web Apps, Lions ( [Will Fisher](https://github.com/teknofire) from [GINA Alaska](http://www.gina.alaska.edu/) )

2. Big Data Worship -- Aerial Structure from Motion Surveys *and* Antarctica/Greenland DEM  ( [David Shean](https://github.com/dshean) from [UW Department of Earth and Space Sciences](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpsc.apl.washington.edu%2Fwordpress%2Fpeople%2Fstudents%2Fdavid-shean%2F&ei=EjsuUsn6Le33igL774GoAg&usg=AFQjCNHYtpIV9Qcn6YNPDaPFOYFobRKtTw&sig2=Fx9JZVubOn76hssVYgUAew&bvm=bv.51773540,d.cGE) )

###Lunch Session: Lunch (12:20pm to 1:30pm)
Stop by the Open-Source GIS Doctor's Office while gorging on pizza.
This is perfect place to get answers to your questions such as:

* How do i setup Git, Qgis, PostGIS on my laptop so i can follow along in the HowTo sessions?

* What is the best OpenSource tool for my specific problem?

* What types of OpenSource GIS tools are there for the Desktop and what do you recommend?

* How do I do everything with opensource tools that i once did with ArcGIS tools?

* I want to download OSM data and edit it and push changes back, what do tech do I use?

* Is Leaflet or OpenLayers a better client-side library?

* Show me how to write TileMill styling carto!

* What is MapBox and how can i make a webmap in 15 minutes...let's do it!


<h3 id="howto">Afternoon Session: HowTo Presentations (1:30pm to 3:00pm)</h3>
These are not workshops! The purpose of this section is to have an experienced presenter
walk through a workflow, software demo or cookbook. We encourage people to follow along
closely on their laptops. There will be willing and ready helpers from CUGOS on standby
to assist with downlaods, installs and general tech hurdles. But we will not be
making sure everyone is on the same page. Presenters will have a very
detailed and public instruction manual so people following along can walk through it later on their own.

**HowTo Demos** 3 slots open ( flexible timeslots, but go long ): 

<div id="detail">Do you use Qgis to make really nice looking static maps? Do you know the ins-and-outs of OGR Python bindings? Are you
a MapBox map-making whizkid? Then show others your workflow! We want to see talks that 
elaborate *how* things are done with demo. Ideally, your presentation would have a very
detailed and public instruction manual so people following along can walk through it later on their own.</div>

###Overflow and GeoBeers (3:00pm to 5:00pm)
Things will probably run long. So we have some flex time here. When things come to an end
and everything is cleaned up...we go out and celebrate with beer.
