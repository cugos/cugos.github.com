excerpt: September 2013 CUGOS Monthly Meeting at OneOceanCorp (6pm)
---

__Location -  OneOcean Corporation 2201 Sixth Avenue Suite 1102 Seattle, WA 98121 USA __ 

__Loose agenda:__

- [@mpgerlek](https://github.com/mpgerlek) will talk in oblique terms and vague generalities about what OneOcean is working on
- [@thebigspoon](https://github.com/thebigspoon) Let's talk about the structure and speakers for the [Fall Fling Bling](http://cugos.org/events/2013/10/16/fall-fling/)
- [@aaronr](https://github.com/aaronr) will go over all the recent progress to get CUGOS paperwork in order (i.e. 501c6 status)
- [@keum](https://github.com/keum) will lead us through a discussion on where to hold meetings in the future as we are starting to out grow the LT space (this is a good problem to have!)

__Maybe:__

- [@mattmakesmaps](https://github.com/mattmakesmaps) maybe talks about geojson.io and all the coolness!
- [@mapsam](https://github.com/svmatthews) - Maybe give us a rundown on http://giscollective.org/ and some of the cool new stuff making the news there.
