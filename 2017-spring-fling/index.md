event_time: "8:30 AM - 6:00 PM"
event_description: "The CUGOS Spring Fling is a full-day event centered around open source geography. This is a great way to learn about new mapping software, hear how companies are integrating location into their products, and get some hands-on experience with important tools like Leaflet, AWS, Turf.js, and QGIS. We welcome students, professionals, map lovers, coders, and anyone with a passion for learning about spatial information. The Spring Fling is designed for anyone with an interest in maps and open source software."

    title: Reconstructing the history of the Ebola epidemic
    speaker: Gytis Dudas
    description: |
      The 2013-2015 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa has been unprecedented in its magnitude and duration. Advances in genetic sequencing technologies have given us complete virus genomes from over 5% of known cases and sequence data were employed for the first time to direct near real time healthcare response on the ground. On behalf of my numerous colleagues and international collaborators I will show how our team used state-of-the-art methods to reconstruct the history of the epidemic from sequence data from its inception in late 2013 to its decline and extinction in 2015. I will describe what our model told us about the drivers of the epidemic and issues of logistics and data availability we encountered along the way.

    title: Seattle zoning and equitable school access
    speaker: Margaret Morales
    description: |
      Margaret will showcase Sightline Institute’s maps created in CARTO linking Seattle city zoning with access to the city’s public schools and parks. The maps show that highly restrictive single-family zoning segregates attendance at the city’s top public elementary schools, making the student body disproportionately white, non-poor, and English speaking. Park access is similarly unbalanced across the city. Mrs. Morales works at the Sightline Institute, Cascadia’s sustainability think tank, where she focuses on housing policy solutions that make Seattle a more walkable, welcoming, and sustainable city.

    title: Searching for Pokemon Go
    speaker: Mike Patterson
    description: |
      Mike loves catching Pokemon. He will describe how a data structure called KD-Trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) can help calculate minimum distances between set of locations, using the example of Pokemon in Hong Kong. Then he will show how to scale these trees to billions of locations using Apache Spark.

    title: A Cartographic Map of Lake Como Cycling Routes Using QGIS
    speaker: Jill Bodnar
    description: |
      What's better than maps, bikes, and Italy? Combining all 3 in QGIS! The Lombardy region of Lake Como, Italy, has a long history of professional cycling races and is a favored destination for cyclists to train and visit on holiday. Over the past two years it has become my home away from home and I found a need for a comprehensive cycling map of the area. As a personal project I have been exploring the world of QGIS to create a cartographic map of cycling routes in the area. I'll describe the background of the project, the data I've used, and what I've learned about cartography and features in QGIS.
