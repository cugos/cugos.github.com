    title: "Beyond Civic Tech: Public Mechanics Starts at Home"
    time: ~
    speaker: <a href="https://www.ronbronson.design/">Ron Bronson</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Ron Bronson</strong> brings a unique mix of service design, delivery leadership, and critical urbanism to public sector technology. He led large-scale digital delivery teams in government, most recently at <strong>18F</strong>, and this year launched the all-volunteer <strong>Portland Digital Corps</strong>. He also teaches in the Urban Technology program at the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>.
    description: |
      Civic tech often overpromises and underdelivers, focusing on apps or dashboards instead of the systems that quietly keep public life running. Public mechanics is a framework for seeing the rules, workarounds, and repair practices that hold services together after the launch moment has passed. This keynote explores why the “last mile” of delivery is always political, how resilient processes safeguard against misuse, and why the unglamorous work of maintenance is what makes systems durable and worthy of public trust.

    title: "OpenStreetMap in the hands of students: experiences from CWU"
    time: ~
    speaker: <a href="https://www.cwu.edu/about/directory/geography/sterling-quinn.php">Sterling Quinn</a> | Central Washington University
    bio: |
      <strong>Dr. Sterling Quinn</strong> is an associate professor in the Geography Department at <strong>Central Washington University</strong>. He is interested in the politics of online maps and the human factors that surround FOSS development and adoption. He has published academic papers on the social influences behind crowdsourced projects like OpenStreetMap and Mapillary. Dr. Quinn's commentary has appeared in NPR Marketplace, Al Jazeera, and the Los Angeles Times, and he has been a regular speaker at FOSS4G.
    description: |
      The university classroom can be a place where people get their first introduction to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in an environment where they can receive guidance and feedback about their work. Academic and extracurricular activities with OSM provide students an opportunity to think critically about the crowdsourced data model and ways to add features that offer a high social value to the map. This presentation will share some ways that OSM has been incorporated into the Geography curriculum at Central Washington University (CWU). This includes training students on how to edit OSM, as well as involving students in research that uses, inventories, and builds OSM. We will also show how student coursework and events increased the richness of OSM data in under-mapped communities in the Pacific Northwest.

    title: Using LLMs to enhance your FOSS geodata workflow
    time: ~
    speaker: Hal Mueller
    bio: |
      <strong>Hal Mueller</strong> fell into the FOSS4G world in grad school when he used an early version of GRASS to generate habitat datasets for predator/prey modeling. He keeps one foot in the FOSS4G data world and one foot in the Apple ecosystem, incorporating geodata into applications for iPhone, Vision Pro, and web.
    description: |
      Modern LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude can be effective partners as you assemble and analyze open source geodata, but you need to keep them on a short leash and maintain an understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. We will review case studies you can apply to your work today. You will learn how to use LLMs to construct scripts for data download, webscraping, and data cleanup; to update an obsolete codebase; and to understand the legacy code you just inherited and add features and automated tests. We will look at some LLM blind alleys and explore how to recover from them. Code examples are in Python, C++, Mapserver, and Swift.

    title: "Mapping the Invisible Grid: Powering Renewable Energy Development with Open Source GIS"
    time: ~
    speaker: Kristen Narcisi | <a href="https://www.mgn.energy/">MicroGrid Networks</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Kristen Narcisi</strong> is Head of Data at <strong>MicroGrid Networks</strong>, a renewable-energy developer and operator focused on advancing battery storage and grid modernization in New York City. Her work bridges data science, GIS, and infrastructure planning, with a focus on using open-source tools to digitize and understand the electric grid. With a background in biomedical informatics, Kristen specializes in transforming fragmented data into actionable insight, supporting both renewable energy development and community engagement around clean energy projects.
    description: |
      Often described as the largest machine in the world, the electric grid touches nearly every part of modern life, yet much of it remains invisible. Data on electric infrastructure, parcel information, environmental factors, and regulatory compliance is scattered across city, state, and utility agencies, often buried in PDFs or spreadsheets and rarely standardized. This fragmentation slows renewable energy progress and reflects a broader challenge: we live in a dynamic world, but our data remains static and siloed. Access to critical datasets is also narrowing, and much of this information is at risk of disappearing.
      <br/><br/>
      Through the lens of distribution-level renewable energy development in New York City, this talk explores the applications of open-source geospatial tools in bringing structure and context to these complex, disconnected systems. Drawing from work on MicroGrid Networks’ proprietary mapping platform, it shows how efforts to digitize the grid help align utilities, developers, and communities toward the common goal of advancing the renewable-energy transition to make a more resilient grid.

    bio: |
      <strong>Matt Stevenson</strong> is Principal at <strong>CORE GIS</strong>, where he specializes in cartography, spatial analysis, remote sensing, conservation planning, and web mapping. He works primarily with nonprofits and government agencies focused on conservation, natural resources, and public policy.
    description: |
      eRoadMAP is an interactive webmap designed to estimate the power and energy needs for electrifying transportation in the USA at the local level, covering light–, medium–, and heavy–duty vehicles. eRoadMAP helps users identify areas where multiple customers cluster around one or two feeders, fostering proactive discussions between utilities and customers for effective infrastructure planning. Users can view both Energy and Power requirements for near-term electrification needs (projected to 2030) at multiple scales, animate the time series of projections, include or exclude long-haul trucks, filter the number of MWh/Day, and show a variety of reference layers including load capacity, charging stations, truck stops, and demographic characteristics. We used H3 hexagons, Mapbox, Postgis, pg_tileserv, and GitHub to create the map, and will explain how we built it and share lessons learned over multiple phases of design, development, testing and deployment.

    description: |
      For the last 3 years, I have been working on my personal cartography project: a poster-size map featuring an adventurous 3,000 km bicycle trip from the town of Copacabana at Lake Titicaca, Bolivia to the city of Mendoza in northern Argentina with my son in 2022. The cartography project often stalled due to time constraints over the 3 years, but finally I am ready to cross the finish line with a finished poster-size map measuring 36 by 54 inches, printed at a scale of 1:750,000. I will feature the map and take you on a journey showing how the map was created, which data was used and how it was processed, touching on a variety of tools in QGIS and sharing what I learned while demonstrating the techniques and workflows used for specific cartographic styles, advanced workflows, and innovative approaches to create the poster. The techniques developed for this personal project can be generalized into broader cartographic approaches that I will explain, making them applicable to other mapping projects and demonstrating how personal cartographic challenges can lead to generally useful workflows and design approaches.

    title: Model-Based Geostatistics
    time: ~
    speaker: <a href="https://nathenry.com/">Nat Henry</a> | <a href="https://henryspatialanalysis.com/">Henry Spatial Analysis</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Dr. Nat Henry</strong> is a professional geographer and the Director of <strong>Henry Spatial Analysis</strong>. His public health and urban mobility work has been featured in Nature, The Lancet, Bloomberg CityLab, and on the front pages of The New York Times and The Seattle Times.
    description: |
      Model-based geostatistics (MBG) can be a powerful framework for understanding spatial data, but the difficulty of setting up these models has inhibited their widespread use. This talk introduces model-based geostatistics using the open-source "mbg" package in R. Using examples from public health and transportation planning, we will explore different approaches to spatial regression, link our outcomes to underlying spatial predictors, and highlight the importance of model validation in the age of AI.

    title: Identifying environmental drivers of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus abundance in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex using Random Forest modeling
    time: ~
    speaker: Nathanial O'Dell | UW Department of Epidemiology
    bio: |
      <strong>Nathanial O'Dell</strong> is a second year Epidemiology MPH student in the <strong>UW School of Public Health</strong>. His work revolves around using spatiotemporal data to describe trends in vector ecology, specifically as it pertains to Aedes aegypti in the United States.
    description: |
      Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are 2 medically important vectors that have established populations globally. In the United States, Ae. aegypti populations declined post-Ae. albopictus introduction, though both species now can be readily found throughout the Southern US. Despite overlapping distributions, there are few studies that investigate and compare the drivers of abundance at spatial scales relevant to mosquito control and surveillance districts. To address this limitation, we analyzed longitudinal mosquito surveillance data from the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Texas. We trained a Random Forest model on a subset of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus data and meteorological and sociodemographic variables from Tarrant and Dallas counties to predict the abundance of both species within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Additionally, we interpolated predictions to map mosquito abundance at unsampled locations.
      <br/><br/>
      This presentation will explore the structure and wrangling of real mosquito trapping data and the methods used in order to extract environmental and socioeconomic variables to spatial grids in R and their application to mosquito distribution modelling efforts, with special emphasis placed on the implications of spatial analysis for public health policy.

    title: "Dead trees and where to find them: predicting forest mortality in the western United States"
    time: ~
    speaker: Keenan Ganz | University of Washington
    bio: |
      <strong>Keenan Ganz</strong> is a PhD student in the <strong>UW School of Environmental and Forest Sciences</strong>. He uses remote sensing data to study how forests respond to drought.
    description: |
      Tree death is normal and even healthy for forests. However, climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of excess tree mortality caused by drought and wood-boring insects. Understanding why mortality happens would serve several forest management objectives. This presentation will examine our ability to forecast drought and insect-induced tree mortality from remote sensing products, evaluate the role of autocorrelation in this phenomenon, and chart a path for improved understanding of forest loss.
