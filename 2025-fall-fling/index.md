    title: "Beyond Civic Tech: Public Mechanics Starts at Home"
    time: ~
    speaker: <a href="https://www.ronbronson.design/">Ron Bronson</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Ron Bronson</strong> brings a unique mix of service design, delivery leadership, and critical urbanism to public sector technology. He led large-scale digital delivery teams in government, most recently at <strong>18F</strong>, and this year launched the all-volunteer <strong>Portland Digital Corps</strong>. He also teaches in the Urban Technology program at the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>.
    description: |
      Civic tech often overpromises and underdelivers, focusing on apps or dashboards instead of the systems that quietly keep public life running. Public mechanics is a framework for seeing the rules, workarounds, and repair practices that hold services together after the launch moment has passed. This keynote explores why the “last mile” of delivery is always political, how resilient processes safeguard against misuse, and why the unglamorous work of maintenance is what makes systems durable and worthy of public trust.

      The university classroom can be a place where people get their first introduction to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in an environment where they can receive guidance and feedback about their work. Academic and extracurricular activities with OSM provide students an opportunity to think critically about the crowdsourced data model and ways to add features that offer a high social value to the map. This presentation will share some ways that OSM has been incorporated into the Geography curriculum at Central Washington University (CWU). This includes training students on how to edit OSM, as well as involving students in research that uses, inventories, and builds OSM. We will also show how student coursework and events increased the richness of OSM data in under-mapped communities in the Pacific Northwest.

    description: |
      For the last 3 years, I have been working on my personal cartography project: a poster-size map featuring an adventurous 3,000 km bicycle trip from the town of Copacabana at Lake Titicaca, Bolivia to the city of Mendoza in northern Argentina with my son in 2022. The cartography project often stalled due to time constraints over the 3 years, but finally I am ready to cross the finish line with a finished poster-size map measuring 36 by 54 inches, printed at a scale of 1:750,000.
      <br/><br/>
      I will feature the map and take you on a journey showing how the map was created, which data was used and how it was processed, touching on a variety of tools in QGIS and sharing what I learned while demonstrating the techniques and workflows used for specific cartographic styles, advanced workflows, and innovative approaches to create the poster. The techniques developed for this personal project can be generalized into broader cartographic approaches that I will explain, making them applicable to other mapping projects and demonstrating how personal cartographic challenges can lead to generally useful workflows and design approaches.

    description: |
      Modern LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude can be effective partners as you assemble and analyze open source geodata, but you need to keep them on a short leash and maintain an understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. We will review case studies you can apply to your work today. You will learn how to use LLMs to construct scripts for data download, webscraping, and data cleanup; to update an obsolete codebase; and to understand the legacy code you just inherited and add features and automated tests. We will look at some LLM blind alleys and explore how to recover from them. Code examples are in Python, C++, Mapserver, and Swift.

With a background in biomedical informatics, Kristen specializes in transforming fragmented data into actionable insight, supporting both renewable energy development and community engagement around clean energy projects.
    description: |
      Often described as the largest machine in the world, the electric grid touches nearly every part of modern life, yet much of it remains invisible. Data on electric infrastructure, parcel information, environmental factors, and regulatory compliance is scattered across city, state, and utility agencies, often buried in PDFs or spreadsheets and rarely standardized. This fragmentation slows renewable energy progress and reflects a broader challenge: we live in a dynamic world, but our data remains static and siloed. Access to critical datasets is also narrowing, and much of this information is at risk of disappearing.
      <br/><br/>
      Through the lens of distribution-level renewable energy development in New York City, this talk explores the applications of open-source geospatial tools in bringing structure and context to these complex, disconnected systems. Drawing from work on MicroGrid Networks’ proprietary mapping platform, it shows how efforts to digitize the grid help align utilities, developers, and communities toward the common goal of advancing the renewable-energy transition to make a more resilient grid.

    description: |
      In a project testing different physical therapy interventions applied to children with cerebral palsy, we simultaneously collected global positioning system (GPS) and StepWatch accelerometry step count data. The resultant data included 8,033,460 accelerometry records and 6,969,902 GPS records. Data were integrated into a PostGIS database, with data joined by common time stamp. The research team needed a way to review data to determine which data, if any, to censor from the final analytic data set based on unusual locations. We created an app using R-Shiny and Leaflet to display the GPS and accelerometry data on a basemap, allowing the research team to review data interactively on a day-by-day basis. This provided an easy to use and efficient interface for reviewing a large data set. The presentation will include a description of methodology and a live demonstration of the application.

    title: Virtual Plot Alignment for Forest Monitoring
    time: ~
    speaker: Rachel Deininger | <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/flame/">UW FLAME Lab</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Rachel Deininger</strong> is a LiDAR analyst in the <strong>Fire, Landscape, and Adaptive Management Lab</strong> at the University of Washington. Her work focuses on using terrestrial LiDAR to study forests.
    description: |
      Forest monitoring relies on accurately locating preestablished plots, but permanent markers are often prohibited or unreliable. LiDAR technology offers a virtual alternative, enabling precise plot navigation without monumentation. A mobile application can leverage LiDAR scans to help operators align virtual plots with real-world features for improved inventory accuracy, enabling field operators to locate plot centers using LiDAR-derived virtual plots. The application will support scan annotation, offline viewing, and augmented reality-based navigation. Field testing will assess accuracy and usability to refine the tool for operational deployment. A prototype iPad app was developed with three core functions: downloading LiDAR scans, annotating scans offline, and projecting scans in augmented reality. Accuracy and usability were evaluated with field testing in real-world conditions. A LiDAR-based iPad application enables accurate virtual plot relocation, eliminating the need for permanent markers. Field testing will assess precision and ease of use, providing a proof of concept for integrating LiDAR into forest inventory and monitoring workflows.

    title: Visualizing Oregon’s Maternal Care Access
    time: ~
    speaker: <a href="https://www.meghanbausone.com/">Meghan Bausone</a> | <a href="https://digitalcorpspdx.org/">PDX Digital Corps</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Meghan Bausone</strong> is a designer who focuses on the intersection of design, technology, and maternal health by leveraging research and design strategy to innovate maternal healthcare experiences at a systems level. She is currently pursuing a Doctor of Design (DDes) at NC State’s College of Design, where her research explores maternal health systems in rural communities.
    description: |
      Across rural America, families face growing challenges accessing basic maternal health care. In some areas, expectant parents must drive hours for prenatal visits or to deliver at a hospital or birth center. These "maternal care deserts" contribute to poor outcomes, including higher rates of maternal and infant complications and mortality. The situation is worsening. Since 2010, more than 500 hospitals in the U.S. have closed their obstetric units, leaving half of all rural hospitals without maternity services.
      <br/><br/>
      The Portland Digital Corps, in partnership with Oregon State University’s Uplift Lab, developed a prototype mapping tool to visualize maternal health resources across Oregon. The map highlights where care currently exists and how the closure of at-risk locations affects nearby communities. Completed as part of a volunteer-led four-week sprint, this project demonstrates how accessible, open-source mapping tools using publicly available data can empower public health advocates, researchers, and community leaders. By visualizing data clearly, local stakeholders can strengthen funding proposals, inform policy, and advocate for systemic changes to improve care coverage.

    title: Identifying environmental drivers of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> abundance in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex using Random Forest modeling
    time: ~
    speaker: Nathanial O'Dell | UW Department of Epidemiology
    bio: |
      <strong>Nathanial O'Dell</strong> is a second year Epidemiology MPH student in the <strong>UW School of Public Health</strong>. His work revolves around using spatiotemporal data to describe trends in vector ecology, specifically as it pertains to Aedes aegypti in the United States.
    description: |
      <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> are 2 medically important vectors that have established populations globally. In the United States, <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations declined post-<i>Ae. albopictus</i> introduction, though both species now can be readily found throughout the Southern US. Despite overlapping distributions, there are few studies that investigate and compare the drivers of abundance at spatial scales relevant to mosquito control and surveillance districts. To address this limitation, we analyzed longitudinal mosquito surveillance data from the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Texas. We trained a Random Forest model on a subset of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Ae. albopictus</i> data and meteorological and sociodemographic variables from Tarrant and Dallas counties to predict the abundance of both species within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Additionally, we interpolated predictions to map mosquito abundance at unsampled locations.
      <br/><br/>
      This presentation will explore the structure and wrangling of real mosquito trapping data and the methods used in order to extract environmental and socioeconomic variables to spatial grids in R and their application to mosquito distribution modelling efforts, with special emphasis placed on the implications of spatial analysis for public health policy.

    title: Estimating Structurally Complex Forests in Western Washington with Remote Sensing
    time: ~
    speaker: Ethan Spahn | <a href="https://dnr.wa.gov/">WA State Department of Natural Resources</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Ethan Spahn<strong> works as the WA State Forest Biometrician for the <strong>WA State Department of Natural Resources</strong>. His background is in remote sensing algorithm development.
    description: |
      The Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is tasked with identifying, mapping, and projecting structurally complex forest (SCF) conditions across its westside forest lands. This work uses DNR’s remotely-sensed forest inventory system (RS-FRIS)—a height-driven dataset based on aerial photogrammetry— and ground truth plots to train, test, and apply models that classify forestland as SCF or not. This study has two main objectives: (1) assess whether models developed from RS-FRIS could reliably detect SCF across DNR-managed forest lands in western Washington, and (2) compare these RS-FRIS-derived results with other mapping efforts using different methodologies. Over 2200 field plots were sampled to train and test the SCF model. Results indicated RS-FRIS metrics ascribing canopy layers and a measure of mean tree diameter were most effective in identifying SCF from simpler forest structures. The final SCF forest model has a balanced accuracy of 81±1% and predicts 345k acres (23% of Western WA DNR forest lands) as SCF.

    title: "Dead trees and where to find them: predicting forest mortality in the western United States"
    time: ~
    speaker: Keenan Ganz | University of Washington
    bio: |
      <strong>Keenan Ganz</strong> is a PhD student in the <strong>UW School of Environmental and Forest Sciences</strong>. He uses remote sensing data to study how forests respond to drought.
    description: |
      Tree death is normal and even healthy for forests. However, climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of excess tree mortality caused by drought and wood-boring insects. Understanding why mortality happens would serve several forest management objectives. This presentation will examine our ability to forecast drought and insect-induced tree mortality from remote sensing products, evaluate the role of autocorrelation in this phenomenon, and chart a path for improved understanding of forest loss.
