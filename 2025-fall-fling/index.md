    title: "Beyond Civic Tech: Public Mechanics Starts at Home"
    time: ~
    speaker: <a href="https://www.ronbronson.design/">Ron Bronson</a>
    bio: |
      <strong>Ron Bronson</strong> brings a unique mix of service design, delivery leadership, and critical urbanism to public sector technology. He led large-scale digital delivery teams in government, most recently at <strong>18F</strong>, and this year launched the all-volunteer <strong>Portland Digital Corps</strong>. He also teaches in the Urban Technology program at the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>.
    description: |
      Civic tech often overpromises and underdelivers, focusing on apps or dashboards instead of the systems that quietly keep public life running. Public mechanics is a framework for seeing the rules, workarounds, and repair practices that hold services together after the launch moment has passed. This keynote explores why the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù of delivery is always political, how resilient processes safeguard against misuse, and why the unglamorous work of maintenance is what makes systems durable and worthy of public trust.
