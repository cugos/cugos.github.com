## Board roles

The board members agreed to postpone selecting roles for a future meeting, as Kate von Krusensteirn as unable to attend this meeting.

## Action items

* Johnny and Ranek will reach out to Ryan Smalls to transfer bank account to future treasurer
* Open a debit card from that back account and add SASS services (AWS, Tax Software, Meetup)
* Update hello@cugos.org to forward to new board members
* Review [bylaws](https://cugos.org/about/bylaw/cugos_bylaws_2016.pdf) for next board meeting to determine any appropriate changes
* Meetup costs about $350 a year, reach out to Seattle OSM, QGIS, and Maptime to determine if it should be kept up

## Discussion points
* 990 filed for 2020 but issue with processor keeps sending us notices.
* Considering events for late 2021, will checkback in a couple months
* Recruiting speakers
* Moving over additional CUGOS member projects (bboxfinder?)
