    title: Programs for geomorphic analysis
    slides: DanMiller_Cugos_2019.pdf
    time: 9:20 AM
    speaker: Dan Miller
    bio: |
      I think of myself as a geomorphologist (I do have a PhD in geology), and geomorphology involves processes that span a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. To understand geomorphic processes requires thinking beyond the range of features and events observable in a lifespan. Computer simulations and analyses offer a means of posing hypotheses that one may not consider using field observations alone. Since coming to Washington in 1987, I've sought synergy using both what we can see and what we can model, first as a graduate student, then a post doc, and since 1997 working with a small nonprofit research organization and now with a small for-profit consulting firm.
    description: |
        Over the past 20 years I've collaborated on many projects to develop software for analysis of Earth's surface. This has resulted in a large library of analysis tools, all open source, and all written in Fortran. The software is used for tasks such as channel network extraction from digital elevation data, landslide hazard assessment, wetland and riparian zone delineation, aquatic habitat assessment, and analysis of sediment delivery to channel networks from road systems. It is used in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, but I have not been diligent at communicating with folks in my own back yard. I'd like to show what I've got, describe how it's used, see what might prove useful for folks working locally, and hear about other similar efforts.

    title: "Map Quality Measurement (MQM): US Cities Road Data Quality on OpenStreetMap"
    slides: MonicaBrandeis_Cugos_2019.pdf
    time:
    speaker: Monica Brandeis, <a href="https://www.critigen.com/">Critigen</a>
    bio: |
      Map is her passion! Monica owns a PHD on crowdsourced mapping projects after many years experiences in GIS and Remote Sensing fields. She believes map should be made and used by everyone. As a senior data analyst, she dedicated a lot of her time on big pictures and finding directions to enhance map quality from different angles so more and more users can be benefit from it.
    description: |
        The Map Quality Measurement (MQM) initiative started in 2018 to establish a standard methodology and metric to evaluate OpenStreetMap(OSM) road quality and prioritize map error hotspots in the United States. MQM applies the open source ‘atlas checks’ to OSM road data in 51 selected cities in the U.S., ranks them based on the results, and creates vector grid layers to show the map quality in each city. The map quality can be weighted by social-economic metrics (population density and car ownership) to re-prioritize map error hot spots. We also created a web app to demonstrate the analysis results and allow further user interaction. We used open-sourced data and software to create this project.

    title: "OSM Water: How well are Minnesota’s water features mapped?"
    slides: MattManley_Cugos_2019.pptx
    time: 10:45 AM
    speaker: Matthew Manley, <a href="https://www.critigen.com/">Critigen</a>
    bio: GIS Data Analyst at Critigen
    description: |
        Water-related features are an often-overlooked part of the OpenStreetMap model. These features help create the natural context for the map and add important reference information. In Minnesota, a large proportion of these features are derived from bulk imports of data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Our project seeks to understand the degree to which OSM water data in Minnesota has “moved beyond” NHD through edits or the addition of new features derived from additional sources. This project will identify differences between OSM water features and NHD water features in the hopes of identifying how data evolves from the bulk import phase to the current state of the map. Our presentation will include a discussion of the methodology we used for data preparation and analysis, as well as our proposal for improving the quality of OSM water data in Minnesota in the future. This research will be relevant for those interested in identifying gaps in OSM data, mapping natural features, and mapping in Minnesota more generally.

    description: |
        How can we democratize the development of geospatial machine learning models, lower the barrier to entry for students and practitioners in this space, and obliterate the ‘practice’ of geospatial platform commercialization? Leveraging OSM vector data and cloud compute, through such programs such as the University of Washington’s GeoHackweek, we are able to further the removal of the knowledge barrier for scaling ML applications and flood a commercialized marketplace with models leverage-able by a broader community.

    title: Getting weird with geospatial data and the web
    time: 11:25 AM
    speaker: Damon Burgett, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>
    bio: |
      Damon is a Geographer at Mapbox who has worked in Satellite imagery, geospatial data processing, user facing APIs, and creative frontend client applications.
    description: |
        The pluggability and flexibility of Open Source data processing and visualization tools enable left-field "misuse cases" for geospatial data. These "misuses" have led to a number of both fantastically frivolous AND incredibly useful projects. This presentation will explore some of my successful and failed experiments in creatively getting weird, including: Encoding elevation data into pictures - Post-punk elevation visualization (Joy Division elevation maps) - Visualizing when we'll be underwater - Animating weather data - Tiling non-geospatial data - Encoding data into efficiently striking formats.
