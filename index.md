We're a group of developers, GIS specialists, designers, and geographers all gathering under one roof in the name of maps. CUGOS is the official Cascadia chapter of OSGeo. We are active in the spatial community because we believe in the power maps and data hold, and enjoy exploring their interaction from every perspective.

We [meet regularly](/meetings) on the third wednesday of every month and irregularly on Thursdays at different locations. If you're interested in participating in our community, you can find us through the following channels:

* [Slack Group](https://cugos.slack.com) - for daily communication and updates.
