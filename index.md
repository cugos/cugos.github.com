We're a group of developers, GIS specialists, designers, and geographers all gathering under one roof in the name of maps. CUGOS is the official Cascadia chapter of OSGeo. We are active in the spatial community because we believe in the power maps and data hold, and enjoy exploring their interaction from every perspective.

We [meet regularly](/meetings) on the third wednesday of every month and irregularly on Thursdays at different locations. If you're interested in participating in our community, you can find us through the following channels:

* [Slack Group](https://cugos.slack.com) - for daily communication and updates. Send an email to <em>hello@cugos.org</em> for an invitation.
* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cugos) - more substantial posts and tid-bits about projects, conference updates, sidecar meetings, and job postings. Send an email to <em>hello@cugos.org</em> for an invitation.
* IRC - CUGOS has its own IRC channel hosted on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/). You can connect to our channel <strong>#cugos</strong>. If you're new to IRC, there's a [neat web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/) so you don't have to download any software. No invitation necessary.
