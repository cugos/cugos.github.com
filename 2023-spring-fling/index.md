    description: |
      The tension between the capital cost of acquiring open source software ($0) and the operational cost of producing it (larger than zero) has been a topic of discussion almost from the start of the movement. Each era of open source has generated new canonical examples of how production is to be supported (selling magnetic tapes! consulting! open core, closed core, apple core!) and the story continues to unfold. Is open source doomed? Is it the future? What should users do? Predictions are hard, particularly about the future, but this talk will attempt the feat.

    title: From 2D to Spatial - My Data Journey and the Power of FOSS and Geospatial Technologies
    time: 11:55 PM
    room: Bezos (G04 on the first floor)
    speaker: Kristen Narcisi, <a href="https://mgn.energy/">MicroGrid Networks LLC</a>
    bio: |
     Recent grad in Biomedical Informatics. Data Product Manager for renewable energy development company in NYC. 
    description: |
      As a student studying biomedical informatics, I was taught the importance of data-driven approaches to understanding and combatting disease outbreaks. However, I found that while we were taught how to translate data into simple graphs, we were not exposed to anything beyond that visually that would really bring the analysis to life. This sparked my interest in exploring geospatial analysis in my free time using the python library folium.
      My journey into the world of GIS took off when I landed a research internship in the renewable energy sector. Here, I worked at a development company that leveraged FOSS and geospatial data to make better business decisions. This experience was eye-opening, and I found myself drawn to the power of spatial data analysis.
      I seized the opportunity to write my dissertation on the spatial correlations between rezoned districts and remediation sites, tying in the significance of leveraging spatial data to public health. This research allowed me to gain valuable insights into how FOSS and geospatial technologies can be utilized to address complex real-world issues on a public/community level.
      Today, as a data product manager at the same company, we continue to rely heavily on FOSS and geospatial technologies to monitor and understand the intricate NYC environmental/policy, real estate, and energy market.

    speaker: Emilio Mayorga, <a href="https://www.apl.uw.edu/">Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington</a>
    bio: |
     I am an environmental data scientist (or data engineer?) with a research background in oceanography and watershed science. I focus on systems, software and practices for the management and open dissemination of environmental data in marine and terrestrial applications. My work emphasizes collaborative approaches and tools (open source and open data) that engage diverse partners, and this work ranges from local (Pacific NW) to national and global applications.
    description: |
      Nowadays there are gobs of very large geospatial data of all sorts accessible in one form or another online. Many of us are both producers and consumers ourselves. But online accessibility alone doesn't necessarily translate to convenient, scalable access to data subsets; or fully leverage the potential of cloud-based processing. Also, data producers and distributors may face challenges in generating and hosting data in scalable and accessible formats, or even choosing such formats without having to adopt fully new tool sets. I will review the ecosystem of "cloud optimized" (or cloud native) geospatial formats that are gaining ground or have already done so, and discuss some of their common features that leverage web and cloud architectures. I will focus on data formats for analysis purposes rather than cartographic rendering proper, though  they're not mutually exclusive, strictly speaking. Finally, to make this much more tangible and because Python is what I do, I will discuss these formats in the context of Python libraries that support them, using live Jupyter notebook demos.

    description: |
      Among a plethora of methods that aim to develop scalable Gaussian Process (GP) based analysis of geospatial data, Nearest neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) has established itself as one of the front runners with its multifaceted applications. Following Vecchia's approximation, NNGP likelihood is decomposed into product of lower dimensional likelihoods with fixed number of nearest neighbors for each location. This product form facilitates embarrassingly parallel implementation of NNGP, that is responsible for its widespread uptake. We present the R package BRISC, that has been tailored to harness the power of parallelizability of NNGP in multicore setup. BRISC utilizes the NNGP formulation to obtain a sparse approximation of the Cholesky factor of the precision matrix of the full GP. BRISC exploits this sparsity structure for parallelizable implementation of estimation, prediction, bootstrap-based inference of spatial parameters, simulation of large spatial data from GP, and prediction in spatial probit models. BRISC is also utilized in spatial machine learning for non-linear estimation of means in GP with Random Forests. We conclude with an application of BRISC in Transcriptomic Data.

    description: |
      Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV, aka drone) photography is a core technique in remote sensing: the precise measurement of environmental data to inform management decisions. However, amid growing industry demand for UAV operators, academic interest in applications of UAV photography, and growing enrollment in remote sensing courses at UW, most students do not have access to UAVs. The UW Geospatial Club, in partnership with the Precision Forestry Cooperative, intends to purchase state-of-the-art drones for use by all in the UW community pending a current Student Technology Fee proposal. We include a heavy-lift enterprise UAV, the DJI Matrice 300, as well as a lightweight, operator-friendly UAV, the DJI Mavic 3E. We also include two specialized cameras for the Matrice 300: the FLIR Vue TZ20-R thermal camera, and the Zenmuse L1 LiDAR/RGB unit. This equipment serves a variety of use-cases, from senior researchers with prior UAV experience to undergraduate students wanting to explore UAV photography. This talk will describe the technical specs of the equipment and highlight use cases for UW practitioners. Logistical considerations for flying drones, including the FAA Part 107 license, restricted airspace, liability insurance, and flight plans will be discussed.
