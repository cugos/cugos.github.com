**[Dustin Carlino](https://github.com/dabreegster)** will demo some of the user interface progress in [A/B Street](https://abstreet.org) since the last presentation. Including but not limited to map dataviz problems like handling Z-order of bridges/tunnels, editing multiple traffic signals at once, and a way to visualize commuter patterns between different neighborhoods.
