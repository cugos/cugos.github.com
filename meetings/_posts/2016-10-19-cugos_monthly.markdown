This months meeting conflicts with the last presidential debate, so we are going to take this opportunity to have a low key meeting focused on fixing up some infrastructure items for anyone who wants to help out.  Our regularly scheduled meetings will pick back up in November with some great presentations in the works! 

## Agenda (10/19/16)

    * Work toward getting all of the CUGOS business documents posted to the website
    * Solidify election process for upcoming board of director elections
    * Start to map out the next 12 months of meetings, events, and hack sessions/ideas
