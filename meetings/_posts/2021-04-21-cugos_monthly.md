**[Daniel Dufour](https://github.com/danieljdufour)** will introduce [geotiff.io](https://geotiff.io/) and [geoblaze](https://geoblaze.io), two open-source projects about realizing the scalability and power of true server-free processing.  GeoBlaze is a blazing fast raster analysis engine written in pure JavaScript.  GeoTIFF.io is a completely client-side application that uses GeoBlaze and allows people to visualize and analyze GeoTIFFs.

**[Michael J Patrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-patrick-0120783/)** Will discuss an Open Source Community of Practice proposal, Open-Range.org , that made it into the finals at the [NSIN Beat-the-Blaze Hackathon](https://www.nsin.us/events/2021-beat-the-blaze-hackathon/) based on leveraging the [Department of Defense Joint Services DASD(DT&E) TMRC TENA Software Development Activity](https://www.tena-sda.org/) 'Open Architecture'. Some of you may remember the demo of the Naval Research Laboratory's Open Source project [SIMDIS](https://simdis.nrl.navy.mil/ImageGallery.aspx) back when we were at Lizard Tech downtown. Fun fact - [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/news/2018_07_29_35_years_of_grass_gis_development/) came out of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Laboratory.
