**[Christy Heaton](https://christyheaton.github.io/)** will give an update on the Cugos Fall Fling and the [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) coming up in November!

**[Aaron Schechter](https://amschechter.github.io/)** will give a presentation about some python mapping he has been doing recently! Will he be prepared? Only time will tell.

**[Stephanie May](https://mizmay.com/)** is looking for feedback from CUGOS members on whether the process she follows for hosting web maps via Github Pages is useful to others. She presented a map of the [Muddy Branch Trail](https://muddybranch.org/trail/) that follows this formula at [State of the Map US](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ikr5pChylQh3qPIGYNtAf70iAkBZ6XvF-JOPEbWo0Uk/edit?usp=sharing) in Boston June, and is currently preparing [a workshop for FOSS4G International](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2025/talk/review/8TBBTUTZYXAZKEPUMPSEUFQQJWFP7PYC) in Auckland, NZ in November.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
