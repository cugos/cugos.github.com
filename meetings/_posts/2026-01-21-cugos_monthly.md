**[Karsten Vennemann](https://www.terragis.net)** will present selected work from the **[DecLaRe project](https://www.uni-kassel.de/forschung/declare/home.html)** (Decision Support for Strengthening Land Resilience in the Face of Global Challenges) in West Africa, including a decision support system for agricultural crop land suitability and related tools developed for Benin and Ghana. **[Demo site](https://declare.terragis.net/)**.

**We'll also hold elections** at this meeting.

**Anyone** is invited to share a map or project. Questions? hello@cugos.org

🎉 **Congratulations to our newly elected board members!** 🎉

There were 23 members present at this meeting. Each candidate briefly stated what they wanted to accomplish on the board before a vote was taken. A candidate was elected if at least 50% of those attending voted affirmative. The voting record was (for/against/abstain):

 - Stephanie May: 21/0/2
 - Christy Heaton: 21/0/2
 - Karsten Vennemann: 21/0/2
 - Nat Henry: 21/0/2
 - Reily Love: 23/0/0
 - David Askov: 23/0/0
 - Ethan Espie: 23/0/0
 - Stephen Mangum: 23/0/0

All candidates reached the 50% threshold, so all were elected. A future board meeting will determine who has a named position and who is an at-large member.
