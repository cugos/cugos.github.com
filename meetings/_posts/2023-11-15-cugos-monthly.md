**Anthony Stewart**, has dedicated his research to the study of carbon storage in wetlands and will be presenting his initial findings on quantifying the amount of carbon sequestered in the soils of Washington.

**Matt Stevenson** will provide a sneak preview of the soon-to-be-released eRoadMAP that he built with **Meldanco** for the [Electric Power Research Institute](https://www.epri.com/) as part of the [EVs2Scale2030 initiative](https://msites.epri.com/evs2scale2030). The map animates forecasted electricity demand through 2030, as well as projected demand for a 100% electrified transportation scenario, with data summarized using Uber's [H3 Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/). The map was built using [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
