**[Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/)** will follow up on his [March meeting](https://cugos.org/meetings/2025-03-19/) presentation to drill into the use of the Python [HoloViz stack](https://holoviz.org) to create online dashboards (including [this one](https://squid-test1.azurewebsites.net)) for multi-faceted exploration of data from autonomous, depth-profiling platforms in the ocean. The [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu) is the best example of this data type.

**Doug Beyerlein** will describe his project [PublicStairs.com](http://PublicStairs.com), a website dedicated to the discovery and documentation of major outdoor public stairways anywhere in the world. Doug is seeking technical assistance to help revive his website maps, which were lost when the [CommunityWalk](https://www.communitywalk.com/) platform folded in 2021.

**Stu Sutherland** will give a quick presentation about his research into the problem of deleted public datasets that was [discussed](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AqGTtF1mWRGYwvaCrmEUGqrQpTMezkCaokpBjZrAX04/edit?usp=sharing) at the February CUGOS meeting, including an update on work being done by some of the global teams actively tackling that project.

**[Karsten Vennemann](https://www.terragis.net)** will present a fresh version of his South America bicycle tour map (created entirely in QGIS) as a 36 by 54 inch poster plot and will gather feedback for improvements.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.

**[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** Introduce yourself! Or re-introduce yourself! Please tell us about something cool you are working on, playing with, or otherwise inspires or puzzles you. [Add yourself here.](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/blob/main/meetings/_posts/2025-04-16-cugos_monthly.md) or reach out to us hello@cugos.org
