[Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/) will follow up on his [March meeting](https://cugos.org/meetings/2025-03-19/) presentation to drill into the use of the Python [HoloViz stack](https://holoviz.org) to create online dashboards (including [this one](https://squid-test1.azurewebsites.net)) for multi-faceted exploration of data from autonomous, depth-profiling platforms in the ocean. The [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu) is the best example of this data type.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.

**[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** Introduce yourself! Or re-introduce yourself! Please tell us about something cool you are working on, playing with, or otherwise inspires or puzzles you. [Add yourself here.](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/blob/main/meetings/_posts/2025-04-16-cugos_monthly.md) or reach out to us hello@cugos.org
