## Agenda  

**Florian Mayer**, an Ecoinformatician at the Western Australian
Department of Biodiversity, will demo OpenDataKit (ODK) and a new R
interface for ODK Central. ODK is a FOSS solution for field data
collection. CUGOSers who do field work or manage field collected data
will appreciate this introduction and demo. This talk will be given in
a workshop style, so those that want to follow along with thier own
access to an ODK server can do so. [Email

sandbox server before the talk to follow along.
