**Richard Greenwood** of **[Greenwood Mapping](https://greenwoodmap.com)** will share insights from his 30-year career, starting as a land surveyor and evolving into a GIS professional specializing in open-source solutions. He has developed and supported more than a dozen County-focused MapServers in Idaho and Wyoming. These online maps are powered by his custom web mapping platform, built on MapServer, OpenLayers, and PostGIS. The maps provide public access to geographic data and legal documents, and are essential tools supporting county tax assessors, treasurers, and clerks in their daily work.

**Christy Heaton** will briefly talk about the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) coming up next month.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
