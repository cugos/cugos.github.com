[Lisa Enns](https://www.ennsanalytics.com/) will share a fun campground map update. There will be MANY dog pictures. She'll also share something a little more useful, the WorldPop dataset. WorldPop is a more accurate way to quantify population at a local scale and Lisa will share a use case that estimated the number of people with certain types of health insurance within driving distances of pharmacies.

Former Cugos president Ariel Kadouri will be present, visiting from NYC!

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
