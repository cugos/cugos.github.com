[Lisa Enns](https://www.ennsanalytics.com/) will share a fun campground map update. There will be MANY dog pictures. She'll also share something a little more useful, the WorldPop dataset. WorldPop is a more accurate way to quantify population at a local scale and Lisa will share a use case that estimated the number of people with certain types of health insurance within driving distances of pharmacies.

Former CUGOS board member [Ariel Kadouri](https://arielsartistry.com/) will be present, visiting from New York City! He'll share an update on pedestrian related OpenStreetMap activies in [New York City.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/New_York_City)

[Emily Spahn](https://github.com/eyspahn) will present her talk "Find the Seattle Dogs": Let’s use public data to map out the areas of the city where dogs of specific breed(s) reside in Seattle. We’ll talk through the decisions we need to make to go from raw data to a shareable web map, using python-based tools.

[Reily Love](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reilylove/) will share a his experience as a [Climatebase](https://climatebase.org/) Career Accelerator Cohort member last spring as well as information about [San Francisco](https://www.sfclimateweek.org/) and [PNW](https://pnwclimateweek.org/) Climate Weeks.
